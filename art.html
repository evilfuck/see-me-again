        <p>It's honestly been a pretty scary year for me. 2023 was taking the big steps that came with turning 18 and going to college, so 2024 was about learning how to live in the shoes of a proper adult for me. A lot of good things happened to me personally, like properly getting used to both my majors, getting my driver's license and losing likeâ€¦ 30 kilos, like a buncha good stuff happened, I'm rlly proud!! But also a lot of bullshit happened that made this year a pain. Genuinely feels like i got over so many challenges, so much happened it felt like multiple years went by in just one LOL<br>I feel like this next year is, for a lot of us, gonna continue, or even start that scary journey of adulthood. It's been hard so far but, taking that first step into the rest of your life is honestly pretty cool. You should be proud that you've made it to here!<br>Be the change you wanna see in the world. Keep on moving foward with your goals, and never, EVER settle for less. Let's hope for an awesome 2025!<br><br>-Ito</p>

        <p>This year has admittely sort of sucked for me, it was going fine till the 29 of october where a massive flood destroyed a lot of my home town, i was out of power for days, we had to accept food from others, we lost our car and ive had to do extra hours to keep the company i work on from not dying. But despite all I'm still here, alive and well, experiences like this sort of mark you for life and make you aprecciate your life more, so thats what my new year resolution is gonna be, spend more times with those you care for and help them when needed, i've tried to give everyone a bit of christmas cheer despite how shit this year ended, better to find better memories than be stuck in old shitty ones.</p>
