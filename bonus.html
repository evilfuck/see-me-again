Bonding over summer in 2022 was so fun and I'd give anything to have time like that again LOL.. You're super smart and deserve a lot more respect for the work you do, the things you've made for FAF are INSANE?? I can't even begin to think on how you made the overworld editor, that's some next level bullshit I'll never understand. You're a goat, but you look too much like sonic.exe and that scares me</p>
