            <br><h3>Griffin</h3><br>
            <p>Griffin.... You've always been one of the funniest people I've known and that point has been proven even further this year. Not only that, but I've seen you grow insanely with your music and artistic talent. You are one of the best musicians I know, and not only that but you're also one of the closest friends I have. We've known eachother since early 2021.. thats crazy man. Glad to say I'm still your friend after so long!</p>

            <p>I cannot believe how much I've gotten to see you grow. You are so fucking talented it's insane, going from shit like Desktop V1 to ANY song you've made in recent memory isn't even comparable. I'm so glad I know you and we're still close, you're so funny and creative and I'm happy to say you're one of the closest friends I have. Meeting you from a help wanted post for VS A Shitty Laptop I posted in the KADE ENGINE SERVER is insane üò≠</p>
